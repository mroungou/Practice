# Exercise 11: Write a program to display all prime numbers within a range


# Note: A Prime Number is a number that cannot be made by multiplying other whole numbers. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers

# Examples:

# 6 is not a prime mumber because it can be made by 2Ã—3 = 6
# 37 is a prime number because no other whole numbers multiply together to make it.
